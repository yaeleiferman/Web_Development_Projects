    <h1>Umberto, The Wise Dolphin</h1>
    <div><img src="images/cute-dolphin.jpg" alt="Cute dolphin swimming" /></div>
    <p>
      Umberto is known as the wisest of all living <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin">dolphins</a>. In fact some say that he is the wisest 
      of any dolphin which has ever lived. This may be because Umberto is himself immortal, and has been
      soaking up wisdom (and seawater) for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>Some of Umberto's favorite things are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>avocados</li>
      <li>repulsive puns</li>
      <li>fine dining</li>
    </ul>
